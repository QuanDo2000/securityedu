# Constraint

## Economic

- The solution utilizes free solutions to host and deliver the website to all users. This will be a limiting factor on some features that the website can have.
- This solution will be purely informational and not used to contribute to economic development.

## Security

- Security concerns will be a big focus of the project. As this is a project about cybersecurity practices, it is expected that our solution will also have to implement any method possible to keep the website secure.
- Other than that, there is no user privacy concern at the moment because the site does not have user authentication system and will not store any user information. This is subjected to change if needed.

## Social

- This project aim is to inform and educate so this will benefit anyone who is looking into cybersecurity and hoping to reinforce their online presence.

## Diversity / Cultural

- Our project's aim is to provide methods that will be used across a wide variety of platforms and devices but the content will mainly be in English. This is a major constraint for a non-English reader as there could be subject specific terms.
