# iPhone + iPad

The configuration of Apple devices is very user-friendly, simplifying various settings, and assigning most permissions to users. When using an iPhone or iPad, users should pay attention to the following general points.

## 1. System Security

You should ensure that your iPhone device is in the latest version of the system, and the automatic update will be activated in the system settings. The automatic updates we recommend here are turned on under the same iOS version, often referred to as a minor version. For example, the latest system is iOS16, what we need to do is to update under the iOS16 version. If you go from iOS15 to iOS16, you need to pay attention to hardware or mobile phone adaptation issues.

1. Go to settings
2. General
3. Then software update
4. Turn on automatic updates

### 1.1 System or account is under attack

If your deviceâ€™s system or account is under attack, you can use Apple's own lockdown mode. Apple officially said: "Lockdown Mode automatically protects Safari, Messages, Home, and many other Apple services and apps." (Apple support, 2022). In this case, your device and account will be protected to a certain extent to avoid data theft or loss of some built-in important applications.
The specific operation steps are:

1. Go to settings.
2. Privacy & Security.
3. Then turn on lockdown mode.

## 2. Password Security

### 2.1 Enables two-factor authentication

Enables the two-factor authentication of the Apple id in the device to prevent the Apple id from being logged in by someone other than himself, and enables multiple password settings in the local device, such as pin code, face unlock, etc. As Apple support said: "Setting a passcode to unlock iPhone is the most important thing you can do to safeguard your device." (Apple support, 2022). In fact, for mobile devices or other mobile devices, the unlock password of the device plays a very important role. Be sure to use a strong password when setting a password.

Set two-factor authentication for your apple id:

1. Settings
2. Click [account name]
3. Password & security
4. Turn on two-factor authentication and continue
5. Enter phone number that yours
6. Verify your phone number by verification code

### 2.2 Set password for your iPhone or iPad

Setting a password for your device is as important as your device's strongest line of defense, although it's the first line of defense. On devices with Touch ID or Face ID enabled, the default passcode is six digits, which means there are a million possible passcode combinations. And after a few mistakes, the time limit for re-entering the password will be extended accordingly. So, it is even more difficult to crack the password, which is why it is necessary to add this seemingly inconspicuous password setting. The specific settings are as follows:

1. Settings
2. Face ID & Password
3. Turn on face id
4. Then fallow instruction on screen
5. Turn on password

### 3. Application security or permission assignment security

When downloading an application in the Apple app store, it should be given appropriate permissions after completion. For example, suppose that in a shopping app, you only want to browse, shop, and do not publish content. You should turn off the photo access permission and turn off the location permission. You don't need to turn on the fine location permission when you open it in time. In other words, all permissions that are not necessary should be closed, otherwise the developer may collect your information or leak it. Even the collected information is used for illegal and criminal work. Uninstall some non-well-known apps that have a wide range of permissions.

### 4. Apple account information is safe to call

When logging in to the app, you can use the apple account that comes with Apple to log in, which can reduce the interaction of too many other social accounts, thereby reducing certain risks. This eliminates the need to create and remember new passwords, and accounts are protected by two-factor authentication.

When logging in to third-party software with apple id, the specific steps:

1. Click "Sign in with Apple"
2. Check the displayed AppleID, then tap Continue.
3. Use Face ID for authentication.

And users can turn off forwarding emails: just turn off "Forward to". Or change your email address.
