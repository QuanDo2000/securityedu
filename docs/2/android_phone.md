# Android Phones

The android mobile phone system is open source, so many functions or permissions are not user-friendly, or in many cases, it depends on the construction of a specific system. We will provide some problems, solutions and configuration optimization schemes represented by Samsung mobile phones as android mobile phones in the early stage.

## 1. System Security

Should still follow the latest version released by the system developer for update and installation.

## 2. Password Security

Should open the system password setting. Be sure to use a strong password when setting a password.

## 3. Third-party App Password Storage

Try to use only the official password to save the application.

## 4. Application Security

When downloading an app in the App Store, the appropriate permissions should be granted when done. For example, shopping sites shouldn't have access to personal information such as your photos and contacts. You should categorize the various permissions and close sections. For apps with all permissions, you should try to avoid using or uninstall them.

The software should be downloaded from the store provided by Samsung or a third-party authoritative store (play store) or the corresponding official website. After installing the software, perform security configuration, such as the configuration of various apps permissions. For example, suppose that in the shopping app, you are only for browsing, shopping, and will not publish content. You should close the photo access permission and the location permission. It is not necessary to turn on fine location permission even if it is turned off and turned on in time. In other words, all permissions that are not necessary are closed.

## 5. External Storage

For some mobile phones, there will be micro SD added. The files in this card also need to be carefully managed, otherwise sensitive information can easily be leaked.
