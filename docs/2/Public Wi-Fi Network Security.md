# Public Wi-Fi Network Security

The security of public Wi-Fi is a very big problem, and we can't avoid using it in many cases, so the following steps are required for the settings of mobile devices!

## 1.1	Setting prohibits automatic connection to Wi-Fi.

The settings in the mobile phone prohibit automatic connection to Wi-Fi. When the network setting in the mobile device is in the state of automatically connecting to Wi-Fi, the device will automatically scan after entering an area with Wi-Fi and connect to some networks without passwords. Such websites are likely to have information and data leakage. And increase the probability of connecting to phishing Wi-Fi.

## 1.2 Use authoritative Wi-Fi scanning software.

Download the local authoritative Wi-Fi scanning software on the mobile phone. Most mainstream security vendors provide corresponding software. Therefore, using Wi-Fi professional software to scan the surrounding Wi-Fi can reduce some risks. And this professional scanning software can automatically recommend a safer Wi-Fi connection for you.

## 1.3 Using a VPN

When mobile devices connect to Wi-Fi in public environments, trusted VPN software can be used. The use of a VPN can bring increased security and privacy to your device. Usually, the data you browse on the website may be unencrypted sometimes, so after using a VPN, it will become difficult for network operators or others who try to steal data to see the process of your transmitting data by using a VPN. And helps you hide your location. Therefore, it is necessary to choose an authoritative VPN in a public environment

## 1.4 Avoid using important personal information on the website.

Try or prohibit the use of credit card or personal privacy information under public Wi-Fi, because these operations may cause your password to be leaked with a high probability, resulting in property damage and data leakage.
