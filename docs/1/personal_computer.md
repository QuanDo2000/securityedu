Almost everyone today has a personal computer that they have access to, but most don’t know how to take the steps to properly secure their PC. Keeping your computer secure will help avoid hacking attempts, malware, and loss of personal information.

## 1. Keeping your PC up- to date

1.1 The most important and easiest step a user can take it to keep their device up to date with current updates. You can turn on automatic updates for your computer and this will keep your Windows, Microsoft Office, and other Microsoft applications up to date.

1.2 Turn on automatic updates for non-Microsoft software as well, especially browsers. 95% of websites risk operating on outdated software with known vulnerabilities. With this high of a percentage, it makes it clear how important it is to have everything up to date to give yourself the best defense you can in avoiding malware.

## 2. Know and understand what you download

2.1 Another step you can take is to make sure you are using an anti-virus software to help scan documents and detect and potential threats before they make it to your device. With Windows you already have Windows defender security center or Windows Security installed, but 3rd party applications can be applied as well. Being able to recognize types of files that you are downloading can help quickly spot potential malware being downloaded and you may be able to act quick enough before the download happens.

2.2 Different apps that you also download can be checked ahead of time with site like <https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload> which you can enter the URL and it will tell you have it has any malicious hits or viruses from any point in the past.

## 3. Proper password security

Making sure you have proper password selection is very important as many people save all of their passwords on their computer with autofill. People use their personal emails to connect all their accounts and passwords together, so it is very important that proper password usage with minimum 8 characters, at least 1 uppercase letter, number, and symbol as it makes password cracks much harder.

3.1 Using different password for each site or login that you have is very helpful as if one password gets leaked, you don’t lose access or have to change the passwords to all of your accounts.

3.2 You can go online and search if your emails, usernames, or even phone numbers have been found in any data leaks. A good website to test this is <https://haveibeenpwned.com/>. This site will tell you if you have been involved in a data leak, what caused it, and where the data may have ended up.

## 4. Understand what you are browsing

Knowing how to browse the web safely and only visit trusted sites will help keep your personal computer away from the risk of potentially downloaded malware by an accidental click, or disguised hyperlink.

4.1 Make sure that you are using a more recent browser like google chrome or Microsoft edge. Some of the older browsers have major exploits and are not as updated as the newer ones.

4.2 Make sure you are visiting websites with updated certificates which you can check in the top left corner of your browser on each site right next to the URL. Sites with expired certificates means that they are not updated by the website admin and the URL could be compromised or malware could be present within the links.

## 5. Using a VPN

VPNs are used to safely browse the internet as they encrypt your internet traffic and will disguise your identity online connection. They will make it much harder for potential threats to track what you are doing or where you are doing it from.

5.1 There are plenty of VPN options online, some being free, and paid VPNs giving additional features like location choice, unlimited time, and extra security.

5.2 While using public Wi-Fi you should be more likely to use a VPN as public Wi-Fi anyone can’t connect to and sniff through data traffic which can lead to stolen data.

## 6. Back up your computer

6.1 Back up your hard drive on another USB or online storage. If your data is stolen, lost, or changed from a breach you can restore all of your data files and keep all of your documents. You can back these up through cloud accounts, file history, or online places like a google drive.
